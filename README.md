The last company I interned for was cooperating with many other external companies and there was a huge amount of document flow with those external companies. Every time a document arrived at our company someone had to manually assign who was supposed to work on it. I came up with the idea of automizing this process using machine learning. With the help of natural language processing techniques, I developed a model which had an 80 percent precision rate of successfully predicting the relevant employees for the given document.
